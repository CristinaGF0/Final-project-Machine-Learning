# Final-project-Machine-Learning- Attrition 
As my first venture into machine learning, I embarked on a project to tackle the issue of employee attrition using IBMâ€™s dataset. This project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply data science techniques to real-world problems and gain insights into factors affecting employee retention.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict employee attrition by applying machine learning techniques to a dataset provided by IBM. By analyzing this data, the project aims to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and develop actionable strategies to improve retention and reduce attrition within organizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. This dataset contains detailed information about IBM employees, including demographic, work-related, and performance characteristics.

## Project Structure
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
This notebook focuses on understanding the dataset through statistical summaries, visualizations, and initial observations. It includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and identifying patterns or trends within the data.
### 2. Initial Hyperparameter-Tuned Models:
This notebook covers the development and tuning of initial machine learning models. It involves selecting and fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance. Various algorithms are tested and evaluated to determine their effectiveness.
### 3. Feature Engineering, Class Balancing, and Final Model:

This notebook addresses advanced steps including feature engineering to create new attributes, balancing class distributions to handle imbalanced datasets, and developing the final model. It involves applying techniques to improve model accuracy and robustness.
