# Final-project-Machine-Learning
As my first venture into machine learning, I embarked on a project to tackle the issue of employee attrition using IBMâ€™s dataset. This project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply data science techniques to real-world problems and gain insights into factors affecting employee retention.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict employee attrition by applying machine learning techniques to a dataset provided by IBM. By analyzing this data, the project aims to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and develop actionable strategies to improve retention and reduce attrition within organizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, available on Kaggle. This dataset contains detailed information about IBM employees, including demographic, work-related, and performance characteristics.

## Project Structure
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analysis of employees' demographic and work characteristics.
- Data visualization to identify patterns and relationships.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
### 2. Data Preparation:
- Handling missing values and incomplete data.
- Encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
- Normalization and scaling of features.
### 3. Predictive Modeling:
- Implementation of machine learning models, including logistic regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Model performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selection of the best model based on performance on the test dataset.
### 4. Results Analysis:
- Interpretation of model results.
- Identification of the most important features influencing employee attrition.
- Visualization of results using charts and tables.
### 5. Conclusions and Recommendations:
- Summary of key findings.
- Actionable recommendations to reduce employee attrition based on analysis results.
